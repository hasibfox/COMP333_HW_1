# Software Engineering Homework 1
This is the first project for the COMP 333 class at Wesleyan University. In it, we must to build a landing page for a music player app through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if necessary. In my attempt, I aim to have a responsive and relatively accessible page with the following sections:
* Hero Page
* About Section
* Features Section
* Demo Section
* Pricing Section
* Contact Section
* Footer

The deployment of the site can be found [here](https://hasibfox.github.io/COMP333_HW_1/).
