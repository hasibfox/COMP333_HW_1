# Software Engineering Homework 1
This is the first project for the COMP 333 class at Wesleyan University. In it, we must to build a landing page for a music player app through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if necessary. From this assignment, we gain experience using the terminal and GIT commands. Additionally, we use this to familiarize ourselves with regular patterns and practices that enable software developers to produce healthy websites. In my attempt, I aim to have a responsive and relatively accessible page with the following sections:
* Hero Page
* About Section
* Features Section
* Demo Section
* Pricing Section
* Contact Section
* Footer

The deployment of the site can be found [here](https://hasibfox.github.io/COMP333_HW_1/).
